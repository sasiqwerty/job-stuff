## Guidelines to Maintain Cultured Cells - What is subculture?

**Characteristic growth pattern of culture cells**

The growth of cells in culture follows a standard pattern. A lag after seeding is followed by a period of exponential growth, called the log phase. When the cells in adherent cultures occupy all the available substrate and have no room left for expansion, or when the cells in suspension cultures exceed the capacity of the medium to support further growth, cell proliferation is greatly reduced or ceases entirely (see Figure 4.1 below). Cells should be passaged, or subcultured, when they cover the plate, or the cell density exceeds the capacity of the medium. This will keep cells at an optimal density for continued growth and will stimulate further proliferation. Maintaining log phase growth will maximize the number of healthy cells for your experiment.
