## Lab Safety

The fundamental objective of any biosafety program is to reduce or eliminate exposure of laboratory workers and the outside environment to potentially harmful biological agents. The most important element of safety in a cell culture laboratory is the strict adherence to standard microbiological practices and techniques.

### Guidelines

- Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment. Change gloves when contaminated, and dispose of used gloves with other contaminated laboratory waste.
- Wash your hands after working with potentially hazardous materials and before leaving the laboratory.
- Do not eat, drink, smoke, handle contact lenses, apply cosmetics, or store food for human consumption in the laboratory.
- Follow the institutional policies regarding safe handling of sharps (i.e., needles, scalpels, pipettes, and broken glassware).
- Take care to minimize the creation of aerosols and/or splashes.
- Decontaminate all work surfaces before and after your experiments, and immediately after any spill or splash of potentially infectious material with an appropriate disinfectant. Clean laboratory equipment routinely, even if it is not contaminated.
- Decontaminate all potentially infectious materials before disposal.
- Report any incidents that may result in exposure to infectious materials to appropriate personnel (e.g., laboratory supervisor, safety officer).

### Biosafety Levels

The regulations and recommendations for biosafety in the United States are contained in the document Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, prepared by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The document defines four ascending levels of containment, referred to as biosafety levels 1 through 4, and describes the microbiological practices, safety equipment, and facility safeguards for the corresponding level of risk associated with handling a particular agent.

#### Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1)

BSL-1 is the basic level of protection common to most research and clinical laboratories, and is appropriate for agents that are not known to cause disease in normal, healthy humans.

#### Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2)

BSL-2 is appropriate for moderate-risk agents known to cause human disease of varying severity by ingestion or through percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure. Most cell culture labs should be at least BSL-2, but the exact requirements depend upon the cell line used and the type of work conducted

#### Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3)

BSL-3 is appropriate for indigenous or exotic agents with a known potential for aerosol transmission, and for agents that may cause serious and potentially lethal infections.

#### Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4)

BSL-4 is appropriate for exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of life-threatening disease by infectious aerosols and for which no treatment is available. These agents are restricted to high containment laboratories.

### Safety Data Sheet (SDS)

Safety Data Sheet (SDS), also referred to as Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), is a form containing information regarding the properties of a particular substance. The SDS includes physical data such as melting point, boiling point, and flash point, information on the substance’s toxicity, reactivity, health effects, storage, and disposal, as well as recommended protective equipment and procedures for handling spills.

### Safety Equipment

Safety equipment in a cell culture laboratory includes primary barriers such as biosafety cabinets, enclosed containers, and other engineering controls designed to remove or minimize exposure to hazardous materials, as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) that is often used in conjunction with the primary barriers. The biosafety cabinet (i.e., cell culture hood) is the most important equipment to provide containment of infectious splashes or aerosols generated by many microbiological procedures as well as to prevent contamination of your own cell culture. For more information, see Cell Culture Hood.

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Personal protective equipment (PPE) form an immediate barrier between the personnel and the hazardous agent, and they include items for personal protection such as gloves, laboratory coats and gowns, shoe covers, boots, respirators, face shields, safety glasses, or goggles. They are often used in combination with biosafety cabinets and other devices that contain the agents or materials being handled.

## Equipment

The specific requirements of a cell culture laboratory depend mainly on the type of research conducted; for example, the needs of mammalian cell culture laboratory specializing in cancer research is quite different from that of an insect cell culture laboratory that focuses on protein expression. However, all cell culture laboratories have the common requirement of being free from pathogenic microorganisms (i.e., asepsis), and share some of the same basic equipment that is essential for culturing cells.

This section lists the equipment and supplies common to most cell culture laboratories, as well as beneficial equipment that allows the work to be performed more efficiently or accurately, or permits wider range of assays and analyses.

### Basic Equipment

- Cell culture hood (i.e., laminar-flow hood or biosafety cabinet)
- Incubator (humid CO2 incubator recommended)
- Water bath
- Centrifuge
- Refrigerator and freezer (–20°C)
- Cell counter (e.g., Automated Cell Counter or hemacytometer)
- Inverted microscope
- Liquid nitrogen (N2) freezer or cryostorage container
- Sterilizer (i.e., autoclave)

### Expanded Equipment & Additional Supplies

- Aspiration pump (peristaltic or vacuum)
- pH meter
- Roller racks (for scaling up monolayer cultures)
- Confocal microscope
- Flow cytometer
- Cell culture vessels (e.g., flasks, Petri dishes, roller bottles, multiwell plates)
- Pipettes and pipettors
- Syringes and needles
- Waste containers
- Media, sera, and reagents
- Cells
- Cell cubes
- EG bioreactors

### Aseptic Work Area

The major requirement of a cell culture laboratory is the need to maintain an aseptic work area that is restricted to cell culture work. Although a separate tissue culture room is preferred, a designated cell culture area within a larger laboratory can still be used for sterile handling, incubation, and storage of cell cultures, reagents, and media. The simplest and most economical way to provide aseptic conditions is to use a laminar flow hood (i.e., biosafety cabinet).

## Aseptic technique

Successful cell culture depends heavily on keeping the cells free from contamination by microorganisms such as bacterial, fungi, and viruses. Non-sterile supplies, media, and reagents, airborne particles laden with microorganisms, unclean incubators, and dirty work surfaces are all sources of biological contamination.

Aseptic technique, designed to provide a barrier between the microorganisms in the environment and the sterile cell culture, depends upon a set of procedures to reduce the probability of contamination from these sources. The elements of aseptic technique are a sterile work area, good personal hygiene, sterile reagents and media, and sterile handling.

### Aseptic Techniques Checklist

#### Work Area

- Is the cell culture hood properly set up ?
- Is the cell culture hood in an area free from drafts and through traffic ?
- Is the work surface uncluttered, and does it contain only items required for your experiment?
- Did you wipe the work surface with 70% ethanol before work?
- Are you routinely cleaning and sterilizing your incubators, refrigerators, freezers, and other laboratory equipment?

#### Personal Hygiene

- Did you wash your hands?
- Are you wearing personal protective equipment?
- If you have long hair, is it tied in the back?
- Are you using a pipettor to work with liquids?

#### Reagents & Media

- Have you sterilized any reagents, media, and solutions you have prepared in the laboratory using the appropriate procedure?
- Did you wipe the outside of the bottles, flasks, and plates with 70% ethanol before placing them on your work surface?
- Are all your bottles, flasks, and other containers capped when not in use?
- Are all your plates stored in sterile re-sealable bags?
- Does any of your reagents look cloudy? Contaminated? Do they contain floating particles?
- Do you detect a foul smell? Unusual color? If yes, did you decontaminate and discard those items?

#### Handling

- Are you working slowly and deliberately, mindful of aseptic technique?
- Did you wipe the surfaces of all the items including pipettor, bottles, and flasks with 70% ethanol before placing them in the cell culture hood?
- Are you placing the caps or covers face down on the work area?
- Are you using sterile glass pipettes or sterile disposable plastic pipettes to manipulate all liquids?
- Are you using a sterile pipette only once to avoid cross contamination?
- Are you careful not to touch the pipette tip to anything non-sterile, including the outside edge of the bottle threads?
- Did you mop up any spillage immediately, and wiped the area with 70% ethanol?

### Sterile work area

The simplest and most economical way to reduce contamination from airborne particles and aerosols (e.g., dust, spores, shed skin, sneezing) is to use a cell culture hood.

- The cell culture hood should be properly set up and be located in an area that is restricted to cell culture that is free from drafts from doors, windows, and other equipment, and with no through traffic.
- The work surface should be uncluttered and contain only items required for a particular procedure; it should not be used as a storage area.
- Before and after use, the work surface should be disinfected thoroughly, and the surrounding areas and equipment should be cleaned routinely.
- For routine cleaning, wipe the work surface with 70% ethanol before and during work, especially after any spillage.
- You may use ultraviolet light to sterilize the air and exposed work surfaces in the cell culture hood between uses.
- Using a Bunsen burner for flaming is not necessary nor is it recommended in a cell culture hood.
- Leave the cell culture hood running at all times, turning it off only when they will not be used for extended periods of time.

### Good personal hygiene

Wash your hands before and after working with cell cultures.

In addition to protecting you from hazardous materials, wearing personal protective equipment also reduces the probability of contamination from shed skin as well as dirt and dust from your clothes.

### Sterile reagents & media

Commercial reagents and media undergo strict quality control to ensure their sterility, but they can become contaminated while handling. Follow the guidelines below for sterile handling to avoid contaminating them. Always sterilize any reagents, media, or solutions prepared in the laboratory using the appropriate sterilization procedure (e.g., autoclave, sterile filter).

### Sterile handling

- Always wipe your hands and your work area with 70% ethanol.
- Wipe the outside of the containers, flasks, plates, and dishes with 70% ethanol before placing them in the cell culture hood.
- Avoid pouring media and reagents directly from bottles or flasks.
- Use sterile glass or disposable plastic pipettes and a pipettor to work with liquids, and use each pipette only once to avoid cross contamination. Do not unwrap sterile pipettes until they are to be used. Keep your pipettes at your work area.
- Always cap the bottles and flasks after use and seal multi-well plates with tape or place them in resealable bags to prevent microorganisms and airborne contaminants from gaining entry.
- Never uncover a sterile flask, bottle, petri dish, etc. until the instant you are ready to use it and never leave it open to the environment. Return the cover as soon as you are finished.
- If you remove a cap or cover, and have to put it down on the work surface, place the cap with opening facing down.
- Use only sterile glassware and other equipment.
- Be careful not to talk, sing, or whistle when you are performing sterile procedures.
- Perform your experiments as rapidly as possible to minimize contamination.

## Contamination and Types

Contamination of cell cultures is easily the most common problem encountered in cell culture laboratories, sometimes with very serious consequences. Cell culture contaminants can be divided into two main categories, chemical contaminants such as impurities in media, sera, and water, endotoxins, plasticizers, and detergents, and biological contaminants such as bacteria, molds, yeasts, viruses, mycoplasma, as well as cross contamination by other cell lines. While it is impossible to eliminate contamination entirely, it is possible to reduce its frequency and seriousness by gaining a thorough understanding of their sources and by following good aseptic technique

This section provides an overview of major types of biological contamination:

- Bacterial Contamination
- Mold & Virus Contamination
- Mycoplasma Contamination
- Yeast Contamination

### Cross-Contamination

While not as common as microbial contamination, extensive cross-contamination of many cell lines with HeLa and other fast growing cell lines is a clearly-established problem with serious consequences. Obtaining cell lines from reputable cell banks, periodically checking the characteristics of the cell lines, and practicing good aseptic technique are practices that will help you avoid cross-contamination. DNA fingerprinting, karyotype analysis, and isotype analysis can confirm the presence or absence of cross-contamination in your cell cultures.

### Using Antibiotics

Antibiotics should not be used routinely in cell culture, because their continuous use encourages the development of antibiotic resistant strains and allows low-level contamination to persist, which can develop into full-scale contamination once the antibiotic is removed from media, and may hide mycoplasma infections and other cryptic contaminants. Further, some antibiotics might cross react with the cells and interfere with the cellular processes under investigation.

Antibiotics should only be used as a last resort and only for short term applications, and they should be removed from the culture as soon as possible. If they are used in the long term, antibiotic-free cultures should be maintained in parallel as a control for cryptic infections

## Cell Culture Products

### Cell lines

Cell line is a general term that applies to a defined population of cells that can be maintained in culture for an extended period of time, retaining stability of certain phenotypes and functions. Cell lines are usually clonal, meaning that the entire population originated from a single common ancestor cell

### Cell Culture Media and Feed

A growth medium or culture medium is a liquid or gel designed to support the growth of microorganisms, cells, or small plants. Cell culture media generally comprise an appropriate source of energy and compounds which regulate the cell cycle. A typical culture medium is composed of a complement of amino acids, vitamins, inorganic salts, glucose, and serum as a source of growth factors, hormones, and attachment factors. In addition to nutrients, the medium also helps maintain pH and osmolality.

#### Natural media

Natural media consist solely of naturally occurring biological fluids. Natural media are very useful and convenient for a wide range of animal cell culture. The major disadvantage of natural media is its poor reproducibility due to lack of knowledge of the exact composition of these natural media.

#### Artificial media

Artificial or synthetic media are prepared by adding nutrients (both organic and inorganic), vitamins, salts, O2 and CO2 gas phases, serum proteins, carbohydrates, cofactors. Different artificial media have been devised to serve one or more of the following purposes:

1. Immediate survival (a balanced salt solution, with specific pH and osmotic pressure);
2. Prolonged survival (a balanced salt solution supplemented with various formulation of organic compounds and/or serum);
3. Indefinite growth;
4. Specialized functions.

Artificial media are grouped into four categories:

##### Serum containing media

Fetal bovine serum is the most common supplement in animal cell culture media. It is used as a low-cost supplement to provide an optimal culture medium. Serum provides carriers or chelators for labile or water-insoluble nutrients, hormones and growth factors, protease inhibitors, and binds and neutralizes toxic moieties.

##### Serum-free media

Presence of serum in the media has many drawbacks and can lead to serious misinterpretations in immunological studies. A number of serum-free media have been developed. These media are generally specifically formulated to support the culture of a single cell type, such as Knockout Serum Replacement and Knockout DMEM from Thermo Fisher Scientific, and mTESR medium from Stem Cell Technologies, for stem cells, and incorporate defined quantities of purified growth factors, lipoproteins, and other proteins, which are otherwise usually provided by the serum. These media are also referred to as ‘defined culture media’ since the components in these media are known.

##### Chemically defined media

These media contain contamination-free ultra pure inorganic and organic ingredients, and may also contain pure protein additives, like growth factors. Their constituents are produced in bacteria or yeast by genetic engineering with the addition of vitamins, cholesterol, specific amino acids, and fatty acids.

##### Protein-free media

Protein-free media do not contain any protein and only contain non-protein constituents. Compared to serum-supplemented media, use of protein-free media promotes superior cell growth and protein expression and facilitates downstream purification of any expressed product. Formulations like MEM, RPMI-1640 are protein-free and protein supplement is provided when required.

#### Basic Components of Culture Media

Culture media contain a mixture of amino acids, glucose, salts, vitamins, and other nutrients, and available either as a powder or as a liquid form from commercial suppliers. The requirements for these components vary among cell lines, and these differences are partly responsible for the extensive number of medium formulations. Each component performs a specific function, as described below:

- Buffering System
- Inorganic Salts
- Amino Acids
- Carbohydrates
- Proteins And Peptides
- Fatty Acids And Lipids
- Vitamins
- Trace Elements
- Media Supplements
- Antibiotics

### Cell Culture Reagents

#### Balanced Salt Solutions

Balanced salt solutions provide an environment that helps to maintain the structural and physiological integrity of cells in vitro. Balanced Salt Solutions provide an isotonic buffer system that keeps the cells in the physiological pH range and helps to maintain high viability during short-term incubations.

Available in many formulations and formats, both liquid and powder. All powdered balanced salt solutions are produced without sodium bicarbonate to increase stability. Powder formats will require sodium bicarbonate supplementation, pH adjustment, and filtration at the time of preparation.

#### Trypsin and Cell Dissociation Reagents

Trypsin and TrypLE reagent come in a wide variety of formats to meet the diverse needs of researchers performing adherent cell culture.

#### Sodium bicarbonate

Sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate is the chemical compound with the formula NaHCO3. Sodium bicarbonate is a white solid that is crystalline but often appears as a fine powder. It is capable of reacting chemically either as an acid or as a base (amphoteric). Furthermore, as it is relatively innocuous in most situations, there is no harm in using excess sodium bicarbonate.

#### L-glutamine

L-glutamine is an essential amino acid additive for cell culture
L-glutamine is an amino acid supplement commonly added to mammalian cell culture media. L-glutamine serves as an auxiliary energy source, especially when cells are rapidly dividing and also can be used by cells as a source of nitrogen for the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, etc.

In aqueous solutions such as cell culture media, L-glutamine decomposes into ammonia, which is toxic to cells. To minimize the effects of this, researchers can adopt a fed-batch strategy to continuously feed low levels of L-glutamine into the culture.

The mechanism of dipeptide utilization involves the gradual release of peptidase during culture to allow the gradual hydrolysis of the dipeptide in the medium. This can be compared to the strategy of a fed-batch culture in which L-glutamine is continuously fed into the culture but maintained at low concentration. The result is an efficient energy metabolism and a high-growth yield.

### Media Supplements

Media supplements help mammalian cells produce the proteins that form the basis of biologic drugs. Advantages of using media supplements include customizing the growth conditions of your cells, improving cell viability and growth, and keeping cells healthier longer.

### Growth Factors

Growth factors are the unique cell signaling molecules that play important roles in cell proliferation and development. It's a fact that cell cultures can greatly benefit from the use of pure, high quality proteins.

#### FGF basic

Fibroblast Growth Factor basic, bFGF, FGF basic or FGF 2, belongs to a large FGF protein family involved in many aspects of development including cell proliferation, growth, and differentiation. FGF-basic is a critical component for maintaining embryonic stem cells in culture in an undifferentiated state.

#### EGF

EGF, Epidermal Growth Factor, acts a potent mitogenic factor that plays an important role in the growth, proliferation and various epidermal and epithelial tissues in vivo and in vitro and of some fibroblasts in cell culture. Dysregulation of EGF production has been associated with the growth and progression of certain cancers.

#### BDNF

Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a used in the maintenance of motor neurons and the differentiation of both cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons.

#### IL-2

Human Interleukin 2 (IL2) causes proliferation of T-cells and is a central regulator of immune responses. IL2 stimulates the growth and differentiation of B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, lymphocyte activated killer (LAK) cells, monocytes/macrophages and oligodendrocytes.

#### VEGF

Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor (VEGF), is a part of the platelet-derived family of growth factors. VEGF is involved in endothelial cell proliferation, angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. VEGF has also been shown to be chemotactic for monocytes and osteoblasts.

#### GM-CSF

Granulocyte Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) is involved in many biological responses including the growth and development of granulocyte and macrophage progenitor cells, stimulation and the initiation of differentiation of myeloblasts and monoblasts, and chemotaxis of eosinophils

#### IGF1 (Insulin-like growth factor-1)

IGF1 (Insulin-like growth factor-1) is structurally and functionally related to insulin but has a much higher growth-promoting activity. A variety of cellular responses are induced by IGF1, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. Further, IGF1 is a polypeptide growth factor that stimulates the proliferation of a wide range of cell types in muscle, bone, and cartilage tissue
