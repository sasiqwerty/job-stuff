# Cell Culture Basics

## Cell Lines

Selecting the appropriate cell line

- Consider the following criteria for selecting the appropriate cell line for your experiments:
- Species: Non-human and non-primate cell lines usually have fewer biosafety restrictions, but ultimately your experiments will dictate whether to use species-specific cultures or not.
- Functional characteristics: What is the purpose of your experiments? For example, liver- and kidney-derived cell lines may be more suitable for toxicity testing.
- Finite or continuous: While choosing from finite cell lines may give you more options to express the correct functions, continuous cell lines are often easier to clone and maintain.
- Normal or transformed: Transformed cell lines usually have an increased growth rate and higher plating efficiency, are continuous, and require less serum in media, but they have undergone a permanent change in their phenotype through a genetic transformation.
- Growth conditions & characteristics: What are your requirements with respect to growth rate, saturation density, cloning efficiency, and the ability to grow in suspension? For example, to express a recombinant protein in high yields, you might want to choose a cell line with a fast growth rate and an ability to grow in suspension.
- Other criteria: If you are using a finite cell line, are there sufficient stocks available? Is the cell line well-characterized, or do you have to perform the validation yourself? If you are using an abnormal cell line, do you have an equivalent normal cell line that you can use as a control? Is the cell line stable? If not, how easy it is to clone it and generate sufficient frozen stocks for your experiments?

## Adherent Cell Culture vs. Suspension Cell Culture

There are two basic systems for growing cells in culture, as monolayers on an artificial substrate (i.e., adherent culture) or free-floating in the culture medium (suspension culture).

### Characteristics of Each Culture Type

The majority of the cells derived from vertebrates, with the exception of hematopoietic cell lines and a few others, are anchorage-dependent and have to be cultured on a suitable substrate that is specifically treated to allow cell adhesion and spreading (i.e., tissue-culture treated). However, many cell lines can also be adapted for suspension culture. Similarly, most of the commercially available insect cell lines grow well in monolayer or suspension culture.

Cells that are cultured in suspension can be maintained in culture flasks that are not tissue-culture treated, but as the culture volume to surface area is increased beyond which adequate gas exchange is hindered (usually 0.2 – 0.5 mL/cm2), the medium requires agitation. This agitation is usually achieved with a magnetic stirrer or rotating spinner flasks.

#### Adherent Cell Culture

- Appropriate for most cell types, including primary cultures
- Requires periodic passaging, but allows easy visual inspection under inverted microscope
- Cells are dissociated enzymatically (trypsin) or mechanically
- Growth is limited by surface area, which may limit product yields
- Requires tissue-culture treated vessel
- Used for cytology, harvesting products continuously, and many research applications

#### Suspension Cell Culture

- Appropriate for cells adapted to suspension culture and a few other cell lines that are nonadhesive (e.g., hematopoietic)
- Easier to passage, but requires daily cell counts and viability determination to follow growth patterns; culture can be diluted to stimulate growth
- Does not require enzymatic or mechanical dissociation
- Growth is limited by concentration of cells in the medium, which allows easy scale-up
- Can be maintained in culture vessels that are not tissue-culture treated, but requires agitation (i.e., shaking or stirring) for adequate gas exchange
- Used for bulk protein production, batch harvesting, and many research applications

## Cell Culture Environment

One of the major advantages of cell culture is the ability to manipulate the physico-chemical (i.e., temperature, pH, osmotic pressure, O2 and CO2 tension) and the physiological environment (i.e., hormone and nutrient concentrations) in which the cells propagate. With the exception of temperature, the culture environment is controlled by the growth media.

While the physiological environment of the culture is not as well defined as its physico-chemical environment, a better understanding of the components of serum, the identification of the growth factors necessary for proliferation, and a better appreciation of the microenvironment of cells in culture (i.e., cell-cell interactions, diffusion of gases, interactions with the matrix) now allow the culture of certain cell lines in serum-free media.

Considerations for creating an optimized cell culture environment for your cells:

- Culture media & sera
- pH & CO2 levels (more information below)
- Culture plastics
- Temperature (more information below)

### pH levels

Most normal mammalian cell lines grow well at pH 7.4, and there is very little variability among different cell strains. However, some transformed cell lines have been shown to grow better at slightly more acidic environments (pH 7.0 – 7.4), and some normal fibroblast cell lines prefer slightly more basic environments (pH 7.4 – 7.7). Insect cell lines such as Sf9 and Sf21 grow optimally at pH 6.2.

### CO2 levels

The growth medium controls the pH of the culture and buffers the cells in culture against changes in the pH. Usually, this buffering is achieved by including an organic (e.g., HEPES) or CO2-bicarbonate based buffer. Because the pH of the medium is dependent on the delicate balance of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and bicarbonate (HCO3–), changes in the atmospheric CO2 can alter the pH of the medium. Therefore, it is necessary to use exogenous CO2 when using media buffered with a CO2-bicarbonate based buffer, especially if the cells are cultured in open dishes or transformed cell lines are cultured at high concentrations. While most researchers usually use 5 – 7% CO2 in air, 4 – 10% CO2 is common for most cell culture experiments. However, each medium has a recommended CO2 tension and bicarbonate concentration to achieve the correct pH and osmolality; refer to the media manufacturer’s instructions for more information.

### Temperature

The optimal temperature for cell culture largely depends on the body temperature of the host from which the cells were isolated, and to a lesser degree on the anatomical variation in temperature (e.g., temperature of the skin may be lower than the temperature of skeletal muscle). Overheating is a more serious problem than underheating for cell cultures; therefore, often the temperature in the incubator is set slightly lower than the optimal temperature.

**Optimal temperatures for various cell lines**

- Most human and mammalian cell lines are maintained at 36°C to 37°C for optimal growth.
- Insect cells are cultured at 27°C for optimal growth; they grow more slowly at lower temperatures and at temperatures between 27°C and 30°C. Above 30°C, the viability of insect cells decreases, and the cells do not recover even after they are returned to 27°C.
- Avian cell lines require 38.5°C for maximum growth. Although these cells can also be maintained at 37°C, they will grow more slowly.
- Cell lines derived from cold-blooded animals (e.g., amphibians, cold-water fish) tolerate a wide temperature range between 15°C and 26°C.

## Cell Morphology

Regularly examining the morphology of the cells in culture (i.e., their shape and appearance) is essential for successful cell culture experiments. In addition to confirming the healthy status of your cells, inspecting the cells by eye and a microscope each time they are handled will allow you to detect any signs of contamination early on and to contain it before it spreads to other cultures around the laboratory.

Signs of deterioration of cells include granularity around the nucleus, detachment of the cells from the substrate, and cytoplasmic vacuolation. Signs of deterioration may be caused by a variety of reasons, including contamination of the culture, senescence of the cell line, or the presence of toxic substances in the medium, or they may simply imply that the culture needs a medium change. Allowing the deterioration to progress too far will make it irreversible.

Mammalian Cell Morphology

- Fibroblastic (or fibroblast-like) cells are bipolar or multipolar, have elongated shapes, and grow attached to a substrate.
- Epithelial-like cells are polygonal in shape with more regular dimensions, and grow attached to a substrate in discrete patches.
- Lymphoblast-like cells are spherical in shape and usually grown in suspension without attaching to a surface.
- In addition to the basic categories listed above, certain cells display morphological characteristics specific to their specialized role in host.
- Neuronal cells exist in different shapes and sizes, but they can roughly be divided into two basic morphological categories, type I with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type II without axons. A typical neuron projects cellular extensions with many branches from the cell body, which is referred to as a dendritic tree. Neuronal cells can be unipolar or pseudounipolar with the dendrite and axon emerging from same process, bipolar with the axon and single dendrite on opposite ends of the soma (the central part of the cell containing the nucleus), or multipolar with more than two dendrites.

## Cell Culture Troubleshooting

### Problem: No Viable Cells After Thawing Stock

#### Cells were stored incorrectly

- Obtain new stock and store in liquid nitrogen
- Keep the cells in liquid nitrogen until thawing

#### Home made freezer stock is not viable

- Freeze cells at a density recommended by the supplier
- Use low-passage cells to make your own freezer stocks
- Obtain new stock

#### Cells were thawed incorrectly

- Make sure that you thaw the frozen cells quickly, but dilute them slowly using pre-warmed growth medium before plating.

#### Thawing medium is not correct

- Use the medium recommended but the supplier. Make sure the medium is pre-warmed

#### Cells are too dilute

- Plate thawed cells at high density as recommended by the supplier to optimize recovery.

#### Cells not handled gently

- Freezing and thawing procedures are stressful to most cells. Do not vortex, bang the flasks to dislodge the cells (except when culturing insect cells), or centrifuge the cells at high speeds.

#### Glycerol used in the freezing medium was stored in light (if applicable)

- If stored in light, glycerol is gets converted to acrolein, which toxic to cells. Obtain new stock.

### Problem: Cells Grow Slowly

#### Growth medium is not correct

- Use pre-warmed growth medium as recommended by the supplier.

#### Serum in the growth medium is of poor quality

- Use serum from a different lot.

#### Cells have been passaged too many times

- Use healthy, low passage-number cells.

#### Cells were allowed to grow beyond confluency

- Passage mammalian cells when they are in the log-phase before they reach confluence.

#### Culture is contaminated with mycoplasma

- Discard cells, media, and reagents. Obtain new stock of cells, and use them with fresh media and reagents

### Other Problems

#### Rapid pH shift in medium

- Incorrect carbon dioxide (CO2) tension; Increase or decrease percentage of CO2 in the incubator based on concentration of sodium bicarbonate in medium.
- For sodium bicarbonate concentrations of 2.0 to 3.7 g/L, use CO2 amounts of 5% to 10%, respectively. Switch to CO2-Independent Medium.
- Overly tight caps on tissue culture flasks Loosen caps one-quarter turn.
- Insufficient bicarbonate buffering Add HEPES buffer to a final concentration of 10 to 25 mM.
- Incorrect salts in medium Use an Earle’s salts-based medium in a CO2 environment and a Hanks’ salts-based medium in atmospheric conditions.
- Bacterial, yeast, or fungal contamination Discard culture and medium.
- Try to decontaminate culture.

#### Precipitate in medium, no change in pH

- Residual phosphate left over from detergent washing, which may precipitate powdered medium components Rinse glassware in deionized, distilled water several times, then sterilize.
- Frozen medium Warm medium to 37°C and swirl to dissolve. If precipitate remains, discard medium.

#### Precipitate in medium, change in pH

- Bacterial or fungal contamination
- Discard medium.
- Try to decontaminate culture.

#### Cells not adhering to culture vessel

- Overly trypsinized cells Trypsinize for a shorter time, or use less trypsin. (See Dissociation of Cells from
- Culture Vessels.)
- Mycoplasma contamination Segregate culture and test for mycoplasma infection. Clean hood and incubator. If culture is contaminated, discard.
- No attachment factors in medium For serum-free formulations, be sure they contain attachment factors.

#### Decreased growth of culture

- Change in medium or serum
- Compare media formulations for differences in glucose, amino acids, and other components.
- Compare the old lot of serum with the new lot in a growth experiment.
- Increase initial cell inoculum.
- Adapt cells sequentially to new medium.
